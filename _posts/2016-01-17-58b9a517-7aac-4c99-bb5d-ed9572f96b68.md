You never want to go out your front door without a camera in Cuenca, since you never know what you will trip across.  For the next month or so, there will be many random pop-up parades and festivities, if past years are a guide. Today I crossed Parque de la Madre, enroute to our local grocery store, and came across massive amounts of sawdust on the ground and trees being chopped up -- for art.  Sitting by one of the sculptures is the sign in the upper left, which translates as "The sculptures are on dead trees."

Apparently, some trees died in the park, and rather than dig them up, they decided to bring in artists to create totems.  Since this is a city full of wall mural art, I guess it is not much of a surprise that they took this approach.  A rather nice gift to the city to start the new year with.

I'll be interested to see how these all look when complete, and how they weather in coming years.  Thought you might like to see them while still under construction though.
